## Known issues 
1. Sometimes player becomes invincible and stays like that until restarting game or taking a star.
2. Sometimes some sounds are loud.
3. If you exit from or die in levels with fixed camera, camera will remain fixed until you exit the game.
4. Sometimes player spawns higher than they should (this allows player to climb at unavailable area right after spawn).
5. Due to wider screen you can see parts of levels that you normally shouldn't.

## Distributing
After build, in the distributing folder you need to include executable (uMario.exe), contents of "bin" directory (*.dll) and directory "files" itself. After that, "uMario.exe" will run on every Windows computer.
